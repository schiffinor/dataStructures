     * in this case 10,000. At this point a for loop that creates a Hashmap equal to the output from the singleGame
     * method is created and the winState is extracted from each runtime. Each time the loop runs the current
     * runtime, and the outcome of the game are printed. The win, tie, and loss trackers are also incremented
     * depending on the game output. Finally, the loop finishes and the statistics are outputted.
