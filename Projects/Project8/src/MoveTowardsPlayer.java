/**
 * The MoveTowardsPlayer class represents a player algorithm that chooses its moves to minimize
 * distance from another player on a given graph.
 * <p>
 * Again, I wanted to implement a better algorithm.
 * The choose start algorithm is pretty decent, it just chooses the centroid of the set.
 * I would have prefereed to implement this as an optimization problem comparing the quantity
 * of outward edges per vertex to the measure of centrality.
 * However, time ran out.
 * <p>
 * Lâˆž centrality, the metric we use to define the centroid,
 * is based on minimizing the maximum distance between a vertex and all others.
 * On a hyper-graph or topological surface, this metric is more consistent.
 * However, in a sparse graph like this, it can be less than ideal,
 * as distance is based on arbitrary metrics and can be misleading.
 * Especially considering distance between adjacent points is irrelevant to graph traversal.
 * If the pursuer and evader had movement points they could expend this metric would be more useful.
 * If we were able to account for the amount of outward edges as think ahead this would be considerably more powerful.
